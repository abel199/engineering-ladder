# Engineering Ladder Levels

Jump to: [1](#level-1-software-engineer-i-ic1) / [2](#level-2-software-engineer-ii-ic2) / [3](#level-3-senior-engineer-ic3) / [4](#level-4-staff-engineer-ic4) / [5](#level-5-principal-engineer-ic5)

The Engineering ladder is a tool that helps engineers and managers:
- make development and career plans
- talk about what we’re looking for from engineers in a consistent way
- set a fair level of compensation.

The ladder is a compass, not a GPS.

It's meant to be helpful. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge cases. This is forked and modified from the [Monzo original](https://github.com/monzo/progression-framework).

### How does it work?
The ladder covers all the things we’re looking for from engineers at Glitch. We’re interested in five qualities:

* Communication - your ability to communicate, both verbally and in writing, with others and your ability to provide and receive feedback on your work and behaviors.
* Influence - your ability to shape change in your work, the team, and the organization. This is the skill used by individual contributors to promote positive change without directly leading a team.
* Initiative - your ability to work independently on tasks and problems. Also includes your ability to help others break down work or problems into manageable pieces and knowing when to seek help.
* Mastery - Your technical skills and abilities. There are a myriad of technical skills needed to be a good engineer including mastery of languages, infrastructure, data, computer science concepts, frameworks, engineering process, and testing, etc.
* Leadership - your ability to lead cultural, process, and technical change. This might include being a technical lead or pod lead, where the team doesn't report to you but is rather a team of peers working on a feature or problem. It includes understanding good delegation, driving collaboration, modeling behaviors that improve the culture and practice of the Engineering team.

Your manager will work with you on this. None of it will happen mysteriously behind closed doors. You’ll agree what level of progression you’re going for and what you need to improve on with your manager. It should be clear how you’re doing relative to that at all times.

### Things to keep in mind
- There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Glitch as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, technical leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths in Glitch's engineering team.
- The ladder represents a career’s worth of progression, people shouldn’t expect to fly up it in 18 months!
- Engineering progression isn’t an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.
- As we grow we may add levels but we won’t add them until we need them.
- You can find some more information in these links. If that doesn't answer most of your questions, please ask your manager.

### Give us your feedback!
This is only the first version of our ladder and we really want your feedback.

## Level 1: Software Engineer I (IC1)

Software Engineer Is are at the start of their career. Being successful in all aspects of this role is the principal criteria for becoming a Software Engineer II.

Software Engineer Is have a reasonable understanding of core engineering concepts. They are focussed on expanding that understanding and growing as an engineer. They have a basic understanding of the team’s work, tools and processes and a broad introduction to engineering best practice and productivity skills. They have an appreciation and understanding of software engineering techniques like testing, source control and agile planning and are focussed on learning more about these domains.

A Software Engineer I is capable of taking small well-scoped components of larger projects, features, and bugs through to completion, often with the mentoring and assistance of more seniors engineers. More senior engineers may also help when they are blocked. These engineers contribute to documentation as they grow.

They are learning how to communicate well and how to deliver feedback to peers and their manager. When given a task with unclear requirements they are learning how to ask for clarification, identify underlying assumptions and can work with product and other engineers to help identify and clarify conflicting requirements. They will start to participate more in the technical design process.

Engineers at this level should be learning how to identify issues and learn from them to improve their skills. By the time a Software Engineer I is ready to be promoted to Engineer II they will have expertise in Engineering best practice, tools, techniques and a solid introduction to the technologies in their domain.

### Communication

- "Provides regular status updates to their mentor/buddy"
- "Points out syntactical improvements in code reviews"
- "Writes PR descriptions that provide basic context for the change"
- "Seeks guidance from other engineers, rather than answers"
- "Actively communicates what they are working on"
- "Seeks out feedback"

### Initiative

- "Delivers assigned tasks, working with a more senior team member, and able to take PR feedback to improve their work"
- "Independently works on small, well-defined tasks"
- Looks to optimise existing work (eg Processes, procedures, products, etc)"

### Influence

- "Improves documentation that is incorrect"

### Mastery

- "Learns to write semantic HTML and CSS following guidance and training materials"
- "Learns to write correct JavaScript following guidance and training materials"
- "Uses development tools effectively to increase productivity during development and debugging"
- "Implements simple components"
- "Fixes simple bugs"
- "Asks questions and actions feedback from mentors"
- "Uses git to manage the development workflow effectively"

## Level 2: Software Engineer II (IC2)

There will be engineers in this role with a broad spectrum of experience. Being successful in all aspects of the role is the principal criteria for becoming a Senior Engineer.

Software Engineer IIs display solid understanding of core engineering concepts. They are focused on growing as an engineer, learning the team's tools and current processes, and developing productivity skills, as well as Engineering best-practices like testing, source control, and agile planning.

They are capable of taking well-scoped components from a larger project and completing these tasks in a reasonable time frame. Engineers at this level know when to ask for help when they are blocked. They can own their independent small-to-medium features all the way through from technical design to launch. They provide helpful and actionable feedback in code reviews in an empathetic manner.

They communicate well and are capable of delivering feedback to peers and their manager. When given a task with unclear or conflicting requirements they know how to ask for clarification, and ensure that all assumptions are vetted before work starts to reduce the need for re-work. As Engineers learn they will start to participate more in the technical design process or writing technical specs.

Engineers at this level should be improving the speed at which they learn from their mistakes. By the time an engineer is ready to be promoted to Senior Engineer they will have focused on one or more technology domains as their expertise and become capable of mentoring interns and new engineers in these areas.

### Communication

- "Proactively communicates to their team what they are working on why, how it's going and what help they need"
- "Accepts feedback graciously"

## Level 3: Senior Engineer (IC3)

Senior Engineers are the first level of technical leadership in an Engineering team. The Senior Engineer should have expertise in at least one technical domain and work well with others. They hold a depth of knowledge in systems that enables them to debug those systems effectively without issues. In addition to writing consistently high-quality code they are aware of industry best practices and trends, and have acquired at least one major skill outside of core coding such as monitoring, documentation, integration testing, visual design, or performance optimization.

The Senior Engineer can own technical design and implementation for projects of moderate complexity, and understands the tradeoffs in creating good software in their area, grabbing others for insight as necessary. They can take a complex user story, break it down into sub-tasks, and complete their sub-tasks with relative ease. The Senior Engineer shows initiative beyond knocking tasks off a list; they are able to identify and suggest areas of future work for themselves or their teams. They seek evidence to support their ideas and start to build cases for these ideas. They deliver products with confidence.

The Senior Engineer has end-to-end responsibility for projects of increasing complexity that encompass more than their own development. They contribute to the common code bases and standards for the team. They understand the business that their code supports and use this knowledge to influence their task prioritization. They assist in identifying and validating test cases and can identify regression risks in their features. In general, they can identify risks in code, features, and design, and communicate these to the appropriate parties.

The Senior Engineer is prepared to be thrown into emergency product and production situations, including ones their team has not confronted before. They are able to provide valuable insights during cases of technical urgency but also make good judgements about when to stay out of the way.

The Senior Engineer is known outside of their core team as a technology leader. They participate extensively in code reviews, and be a mentor to less senior engineers. They also share knowledge through code reviews and pairing, as well as frequently presenting at team meetings. They work effectively with non-tech members of the Glitch community.

## Level 4: Staff Engineer (IC4)

The Staff Engineer has strategic impact over some combination of a large team, a very deep technical problem, and/or a long time horizon. The problems that the staff engineer is solving are open-ended.

The Staff Engineer provides considerable high-level technical guidance across the team. They can usually anticipate and plan for technical problems. They are highly knowledgeable in major parts of our technology stack and are the technical owner of significant components of our code base. They have a sustained track record of creating improvements in business-critical systems around stability, performance, and scalability.

A Staff Engineer is still acting in a very hands-on role, and as such, they are a prolific contributor to both core projects at Glitch as well as side and experimental work. When presented with a complex problem, process or existing system they are able to reduce the complexity in order to get more done with less work. They provide guidance, direction and help colleagues build and produce better outcomes.

The Staff Engineer has strong abilities to influence without requiring reporting authority. They facilitate cross-team work and are influential beyond their individual group. They are capable of driving groups of disparate interests to decisions, and clearly communicating and seeing those decisions through to impact.

When presented with a complex problem, process or existing system they are consistently able to reduce the complexity in order to get more done with less work. This ability to manage and simplify complexity is the hallmark of the Principal Engineer; working with this person should leave team members feeling like they are going to leave with something significantly better than they came into.

The Principal Engineer has broad impact across Glitch tech. They create architecture that shapes large parts of our business, and ship complex projects including many systems or major pieces of infrastructure. The impact of their work is felt across the team in the quality of the engineering that we produce, the ways we write code, the core libraries that we use, and the underlying design of systems. There are multiple obvious large technical contributions that can be pointed to as originating from this team member.

The Principal Engineer has excellent abilities to influence without requiring reporting authority to do so. They effectively facilitate cross-team work and are influential far beyond their individual group. They are capable of driving groups of disparate interests to decisions, and clearly communicating and seeing those decisions through to impact.
